# Baburnama

Baburnama is an interactive game inspired by the life of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire. This project combines historical storytelling with modern technology to create an engaging, immersive experience. Players navigate through a maze, triggering auditory and visual feedback that corresponds to their physical interactions. The game employs Arduino and Processing for real-time serial communication to control LEDs and sound effects, enhancing the sensory engagement.

This repository contains the code for the Arduino and Processing programs used in the project. Explore, learn, and feel free to contribute! ðŸŽ®
